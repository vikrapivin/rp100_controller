# rp100_controller
Short and sweet python GUI to control rp100 power supply from razorbill. 

To run this you need to run:

```
conda install pip
pip install pyserial
```

Skip the first command and add --user to the above before pyserial if you are not in an anaconda environment.

Then just run python controller.py. If on linux make sure you add your username to the group dialout.
